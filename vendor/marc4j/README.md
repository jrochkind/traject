The marc4j.jar file that is in `./lib` was created by:

Checking out the marc4j source from github.com/marc4j/marc4j, and building
with `ant` on 23 July 2013.

That produced the jar you see, with the name it has. (I am not sure the version
in the jar name is accurate, it's not actually the beta1 release, but the RC1
release, or maybe even a subsequent release?)

It can be regenerated by doing the same.

Bundling the marc4j jar with our traject gem is not neccesarily the
best way to go, but it's what we're doing now. See top-level README
TODO.

(You can use your own custom marc4j.jar by using a runtime setting,
see Marc4JReader class docs. )
