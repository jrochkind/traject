  # MarcExtractor is a class for extracting lists of strings from a MARC::Record,
  # according to specifications. See #parse_string_spec for description of string
  # string arguments used to specify extraction. See #initialize for options
  # that can be set controlling extraction.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #    array_of_stuff = MarcExtractor.new("001:245abc:700a").extract(marc_record)
  #    values         = MarcExtractor.new("040a", :separator => nil).extract(marc_record)
  #
  #
  # == Note on Performance and MarcExtractor creation and reuse
  #
  # A MarcExtractor is somewhat expensive to create, and has been shown in profiling/
  # benchmarking to be a bottleneck if you end up creating one for each marc record
  # processed.  Instead, a single MarcExtractor should be created, and re-used
  # per MARC record.
  #
  # If you are creating a traject 'macro' method, here's one way to do that,
  # capturing the MarcExtractor under closure:
  #
  #    def some_macro(spec, other_args, whatever)
  #      extractor = MarcExtractor.new( spec )
  #      # ...
  #      return lambda do |record, accumulator, context|
  #         #...
  #         accumulator.concat extractor.extract(record)
  #         #...
  #      end
  #    end
  #
  # In other cases, you may find it convenient to improve performance by
  # using the MarcExtractor#cached method, instead of MarcExtractor#new, to
  # lazily create and then re-use a MarcExtractor object with
  # particular initialization arguments.

    # Converts from a string marc spec like "245abc:700a" to a nested hash used internally
    # to represent the specification.
    #
    # a String specification is a string (or array of strings) of form:
    #  {tag}{|indicators|}{subfields} separated by colons
    # tag is three chars (usually but not neccesarily numeric),
    # indicators are optional two chars prefixed by hyphen,
    # subfields are optional list of chars (alphanumeric)
    #
    # indicator spec must be two chars, but one can be * meaning "don't care".
    # space to mean 'blank'
    #
    # "245|01|abc65:345abc:700|*5|:800"
    #
    # Or, for control (fixed) fields (ordinarily fields 001-010), you can include a byte slice specification,
    # but can NOT include subfield or indicator specifications. Plus can use special tag "LDR" for
    # the marc leader. (TODO)
    #
    #  "008[35-37]:LDR[5]"
    #  => bytes 35-37 inclusive of field 008, and byte 5 of the marc leader.
    #
    # Returns a nested hash keyed by tags.
    # { tag => {
    #     :subfields => ['a', 'b', '2'] # actually, a SET. may be empty or nil
    #     :indicators => ['1', '0'] # An array. may be empty or nil; duple, either one can be nil
    #    }
    #}
    # For byte offsets, :bytes => 12 or :bytes => (7..10)
    #
    # * subfields and indicators can only be provided for marc data/variable fields
    # * byte slice can only be provided for marc control fields (generally tags less than 010)
