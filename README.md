# Traject

Tools for indexing MARC records to Solr.

Generalizable to tools for configuring mapping records to associative array data structures, and sending
them somewhere.

**Currently under development, not production ready**

## Background/Goals

Existing tools for indexing Marc to Solr exist, and have served us well for many years, and have many useful things about them -- which I've tried to preserve in traject.  But I was having more and more difficulty working with the existing tools, including difficulty providing the custom logic I needed in a maintainable way. I realized that for me, to create a tool with the flexibility, maintainability, and performance I wanted, I would need to do it in jruby (ruby on the JVM).

* *Easy to use*, getting started with standard use cases should be easy, even for non-rubyists.
* *Support customization and flexiblity*, common customization use cases, including simple local
  logic, should be very easy. More sophisticated and even complex customization use cases should still be possible,
  changing just the parts of traject you want to change.
* *Maintainable local logic*, including supporting sharing of reusable logic via ruby gems.
* *Maintainable understandable internal logic*; well-covered by tests, well-factored separation of concerns,
easy for newcomer developers who know ruby to understand the codebase.
* *High performance*, using multi-threaded concurrency where appropriate to maximize throughput.
While it depends on your configuration and the size of your server(s), traject is likely higher
performance than other similar solutions.
* *Well-behaved shell script*, for painless integration in batch processes and cronjobs, with
exit codes, sufficiently flexible control of logging, proper use of stderr, etc.



## Installation

Traject runs under jruby (ruby on the JVM). I recommend [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) and [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#readme) for installing and managing ruby installations. (traject is tested
and supported for ruby 1.9 -- recent versions of jruby should run under 1.9 mode by default).

Then just `gem install traject`.

( **Note**: We may later provide an all-in-one .jar distribution, which does not require you to install jruby or use on your system. This is hypothetically possible. Is it a good idea?)

# Usage

## Configuration file format

The traject command-line utility requires you to supply it with a configuration file. So let's start by describing the configuration file.

Configuration files are actually just ruby -- so by convention they end in `.rb`.

Don't worry, you don't neccesarily need to know ruby well to write them, they give you a subset of ruby to work with. But the full power
of ruby is available to you.

**rubyist tip**: Technically, config files are executed with `instance_eval` in a Traject::Indexer instance, so the special commands you see are just methods on Traject::Indexer (or mixed into it). But you can
call ordinary ruby `require` in config files, etc., too, to load
external functionality. See more at Extending Logic below.

There are two main categories of directives in your configuration files: _Settings_, and _Indexing Rules_.

### Settings

Settings are a flat list of key/value pairs, where the keys are always strings and the values usually are. They look like this
in a config file:

~~~ruby
# configuration_file.rb
# Note that "#" is a comment, cause it's just ruby

settings do
  # Where to find solr server to write to
  provide "solr.url", "http://example.org/solr"

  # If you are connecting to Solr 1.x, you need to set
  # for SolrJ compatibility:
  # provide "solrj_writer.parser_class_name", "XMLResponseParser"

  # solr.version doesn't currently do anything, but set it
  # anyway, in the future it will warn you if you have settings
  # that may not work with your version.
  provide "solr.version", "4.3.0"

  # default source type is binary, traject can't guess
  # you have to tell it.
  provide "marc_source.type", "xml"

  # settings can be set on command line instead of
  # config file too.

  # various others...
  provide "solrj_writer.commit_on_close", "true"

  # By default, we use the Traject::Marc4JReader, which
  # can read marc8 and ISO8859_1 -- if your records are all in UTF8,
  # the pure-ruby MarcReader may be faster...
  # provide "reader_class_name", "Traject::MarcReader"
  # If you ARE using the Marc4JReader, it defaults to "BESTGUESS"
  # as to encoding when reading binary, you may want to tell it instead
  provide "marc4j_reader.source_encoding", "MARC8" # or UTF-8 or ISO8859_1
end
~~~

`provide` will only set the key if it was previously unset, so first
setting wins, and command-line comes first of all and overrides everything.
You can also use `store` if you want to force-set, last set wins.

See, docs page on [Settings](./doc/settings.md) for list
of all standardized settings.

### Indexing Rules

You can keep your settings and indexing rules in one config file,
or split them accross multiple config files however you like. (Connection details vs indexing? Common things vs environmental specific things?)

The main tool for indexing rules is the `to_field` command.
Which can be used with a few standard functions.

~~~ruby
# configuration.rb

# The first arguent, 'source' in this case, is what Solr field we're
# sending to. And the 'literal' function supplies a hard-coded
# constant string literal.
to_field "source", literal("LIB_CATALOG")

# you can call 'to_field' multiple times, additional values
# are concatenated
to_field "source", literal("ANOTHER ONE")

# Serialize the marc record back out and
# put it in a solr field.
to_field "marc_record", serialized_marc(:format => "xml")

# or :format => "json" for marc-in-json
# or :format => "binary", by default Base64-encoded for Solr
# 'binary' field, or, for more like what SolrMarc did, without
# escaping:
to_field "marc_record_raw", serialized_marc(:format => "binary", :binary_escape => false)

# Take ALL of the text from the marc record, useful for
# a catch-all field. Actually by default only takes
# from tags 100 to 899.
to_field "text", extract_all_marc_values

# Now we have a simple example of the general utility function
# `extract_marc`
to_field "id", extract_marc("001", :first => true)
~~~

`extract_marc` takes a marc tag/subfield specification, and optional
arguments. `:first => true` means if the specification returned multiple values, ignore all bet the first. It is wise to use this
*whenever you have a non-multi-valued solr field* even if you think "There should only be one 001 field anyway!", to deal with unexpected
data properly.

Other examples of the specification string, which can include multiple tag mentions, as well as subfields and indicators:

~~~ruby
  # 245 subfields a, p, and s. 130, all subfields.
  # built-in punctuation trimming routine.
  to_field "title_t", extract_marc("245nps:130", :trim_punctuation => true)

  # Can limit to certain indicators with || chars.
  # "*" is a wildcard in indicator spec.  So
  # 856 with first indicator '0', subfield u.
  to_field "email_addresses", extract_marc("856|0*|u")

  # Instead of joining subfields from the same field
  # into one string, joined by spaces, leave them
  # each in separate strings:
  to_field "isbn", extract_marc("020az", :separator => nil)
  
  # Make sure that you don't get any duplicates
  # by passing in ":deduplicate => true"
  to_field 'language008', extract_marc('008[35-37]', :deduplicate=>true)
~~~

The `extract_marc` function *by default* includes any linked
MARC `880` fields with alternate-script versions. Another reason
to use the `:first` option if you really only want one.

For MARC control (aka 'fixed') fields, you can use square
brackets to take a slice by byte offset.

    to_field "langauge_code", extract_marc("008[35-37]")

`extract_marc` also supports `translation maps` similar
to SolrMarc's. There will be some translation maps built in,
and you can provide your own. translation maps can be supplied
in yaml or ruby.  Translation maps are especially useful
for mapping form MARC codes to user-displayable strings. See Traject::TranslationMap for more info:

    # "translation_map" will be passed to Traject::TranslationMap.new
    # and the created map used to translate all values
    to_field "language", extract_marc("008[35-37]:041a:041d", :translation_map => "marc_language_code")

#### Direct indexing logic vs. Macros

It turns out all those functions we saw above used with `to_field` -- `literal`, `serialized_marc`, `extract_all_marc_values`, and `extract_marc` -- are what Traject calls 'macros'.

They are all actually built based upon a more basic element of
indexing functionality, which you can always drop down to, and
which is used to build the macros. The basic use of `to_field`,
with directly specified logic instead of using a macro, looks like this:

~~~ruby
to_field "source" do |record, accumulator, context|
   accumulator << "LIB CATALOG"
end
~~~~

That's actually equivalent to the macro we used earlier: `to_field("source"), literal("LIB_CATALOG")`.

This direct use of to_field happens to be a ruby "block", which is
used to define a block of logic that can be stored and executed later. When the block is called, first argument (`record` above) is the marc_record being indexed (a ruby-marc MARC::Record object), and the second argument (`accumulator`) is a ruby array used to accumulate output values.

The third argument is a `Traject::Indexer::Context` object that can
be used for more advanced functionality, including caching expensive
per-record calculations, writing out to more than one output field at a time, or taking account of current Traject Settings in your logic. The third argument is optional, you can supply
a two-argument block too.

You can always drop out to this basic direct use whenever you need
special purpose logic, directly in the config file, writing in
ruby:

~~~ruby
# this is more or less nonsense, just an example
to_field "weird_title" do |record, accumlator, context|
   field = record['245']
   title = field['a']
   title.upcase! if field.indicator1 = '1'
   accumulator << title
end

# To make use of marc extraction by specification, just like
# marc_extract does, you may want to use the Traject::MarcExtractor
# class
to_field "weirdo" do |record, accumulator, context|
   # use MarcExtractor.cached for performance, globally
   # caching the MarcExtractor we create. See docs
   # at MarcExtractor.
   list = MarcExtractor.cached("700a").extract(record)

   # combine all the 700a's in ONE string, cause we're weird
   list = list.join(" ")

   accumulator << list
end
~~~

You can also *combine* a macro and a direct block for some
post-processing. In this case, the `accumulator` parameter
in our block will start out with the values left by
the `extract_marc`:

~~~ruby
to_field "subjects", extract_marc("600:650:610") do |record, accumulator, context|
  # for some reason we want to uppercase all our subjects
  accumulator.collect! {|s| s.upcase }
end
~~~

If you find yourself repeating code a lot in direct blocks, you
can supply your _own_ macros, for local use, or even to share
with others in a ruby gem. See docs [Macros](./doc/macros.md)

#### each_record

There is also a method `each_record`, which is like `to_field`, but without
a specific field. It can be used for other side-effects of your choice, or
even for writing to multiple fields.

~~~ruby
  each_record do |record, context|
    # example of writing to two fields at once.
    (x, y) = Something.do_stuff
    (context["one_field"] ||= [])     << x
    (context["another_field"] ||= []) << y
  end
~~~

You could write or use macros for `each_record` too. It's suggested that
such a macro take the field names it will effect as arguments (example?)

`each_record` and `to_field` calls will be processed in one big order, guaranteed
in order.

~~~ruby
  to_field("foo") {...}  # will be called first on each record
  each_record {...}      # will always be called AFTER above has potentially added values
  to_field("foo") {...}  # and will be called after each of the preceding for each record
~~~

#### Sample config

A fairly complex sample config file can be found at [./test/test_support/demo_config.rb](./test/test_support/demo_config.rb)

#### Built-in MARC21 Semantics

There is another package of 'macros' that comes with Traject for extracting semantics
from Marc21.  These are sometimes 'opinionated', using heuristics or algorithms
that are not inherently part of Marc21, but have proven useful in actual practice.

It's not loaded by default, you can use straight ruby `require` and `extend`
to load the macros into the indexer.

~~~ruby
# in a traject config file, extend so we can use methods from...
require 'traject/macros/marc21_semantics'
extend Traject::Macros::Marc21Semantics

to_field "date",        marc_publication_date
to_field "author_sort", marc_sortable_author
to_field "inst_facet",  marc_instrumentation_humanized
~~~

See documented list of macros available in [Marc21Semantics](./lib/traject/macros/marc21_semantics.rb)

## Command Line

The simplest invocation is:

    traject -c conf_file.rb marc_file.mrc

Traject assumes marc files are in ISO 2709 binary format; it is not
currently able to guess marc format type from filenames. If you are reading
marc files in another format, you need to tell traject either with the `marc_source.type` or the command-line shortcut:

    traject -c conf.rb -t xml marc_file.xml

You can supply more than one conf file with repeated `-c` arguments.

    traject -c connection_conf.rb -c indexing_conf.rb marc_file.mrc

If you supply a `--stdin` argument, traject will try to read from stdin.
You can only supply one marc file at a time, but we can take advantage of stdin to get around this:

    cat some/dir/*.marc | traject -c conf_file.rb --stdin

You can set any setting on the command line with `-s key=value`.
This will over-ride any settings set with `provide` in conf files.

    traject -c conf_file.rb marc_file -s solr.url=http://somehere/solr -s solr.url=http://example.com/solr -s solrj_writer.commit_on_close=true

There are some built-in command-line option shortcuts for useful
settings:

Use `-j` to output as pretty-printed JSON
hashes, instead of sending to solr. Useful for debugging or sanity
checking.

    traject -j -c conf_file.rb marc_file

Use `-u` as a shortcut for `s solr.url=X`

    traject -c conf_file.rb -u http://example.com/solr marc_file.mrc
    
Run `traject -h` to see the command line help screen listing all available options. 

Also see `-I load_path` and `-G Gemfile` options under Extending With Your Own Code.

## Extending With Your Own Code

Traject config files are full live ruby files, where you can do anything,
including declaring new classes, etc.

However, beyond limited trivial logic, you'll want to organize your
code reasonably into separate files, not jam everything into config
files.

Traject wants to make sure it makes it convenient for you to do so,
whether project-specific logic in files local to the traject project,
or in ruby gems that can be shared between projects.

There are standard ruby mechanisms you can use to do this, and
traject provides a couple features to make sure this remains
convenient with the traject command line.

For more information, see documentation page on [Extending With Your
Own Code](./doc/extending.md)

**Expert summary** :
* Traject `-I` argument command line can be used to list directories to
  add to the load path, similar to the `ruby -I` argument. You
  can then 'require' local project files from the load path.
  * translation map files found on the load path or in a
    "./translation_maps" subdir on the load path will be found
    for Traject translation maps.
* Traject `-G` command line can be used to tell traject to use
  bundler with a `Gemfile` located at current working dirctory
  (or give an argument to `-G ./some/myGemfile`)

# Development

Run tests with `rake test` or just `rake`.  Tests are written using Minitest (please, no rspec).  We use the spec-style describe/it to
list the tests -- but generally prefer unit-style "assert_*" methods
to make actual assertions, for clarity.

Some tests need to run against a solr instance. Currently no solr
instance is baked in.  You can provide your own solr instance to test against and set shell ENV variable
"solr_url", and the tests will use it. Otherwise, tests will
use a mocked up Solr instance.

To make a pull request, please make a feature branch *created from the master branch*, not from an existing feature branch. (If you need to do a feature branch dependent on an existing not-yet merged feature branch... discuss
this with other developers first!)

Pull requests should come with tests, as well as docs where applicable. Docs can be inline rdoc-style, edits to this README,
and/or extra files in ./docs -- as appropriate for what needs to be docs.

## TODO


* Unicode normalization. Has to normalize to NFKC on way out to index. Except for serialized marc field and other exceptions? Except maybe don't have to, rely on solr analyzer to do it?

  * Should it normalize to NFC on the way in, to make sure translation maps and other string comparisons match properly?

  * Either way, all optional/configurable of course. based
    on Settings.

* CommandLine class isn't covered by tests -- it's written using functionality
from Indexer and other classes taht are well-covered, but the CommandLine itself
probably needs some tests -- especially covering error handling, which probably
needs a bit more attention and using exceptions instead of exits, etc.

* Optional built-in jetty stop/start to allow indexing to Solr that wasn't running before. maybe https://github.com/projecthydra/jettywrapper ?
